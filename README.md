## 📖 Overview

**VendorConnect** is a B2B SaaS application engineered to solve the "Cost Leakage" problem in enterprise procurement. By digitizing vendor data and automating contract tracking, it prevents unwanted auto-renewals and compliance lapses that often occur with manual Excel-based tracking.

It features a **multi-tenant architecture** secured by **Row Level Security (RLS)**, ensuring that data is strictly isolated between different procurement officers or organizations.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 The Contracts Engine (Business Logic)
- **Automated Risk Alerts:** Algorithms continually scan contract end-dates against the current date.
- **Cost Leakage Prevention:** Automatically flags contracts expiring within **30 days** (Red Alert), allowing teams to renegotiate or cancel in time.

### 🛡️ Enterprise-Grade Security
- **Multi-Tenancy:** Built on Supabase Auth & RLS. Users can only access and manipulate their *own* vendor data.
- **Compliance Tracking:** Integrated "Report Vendor" workflow to flag non-compliant suppliers instantly.

### 📊 Executive Dashboard
- **Real-Time KPIs:** Dynamic calculation of *Total Spend*, *Active Contracts*, and *Compliance Rates*.
- **Instant Search:** Client-side fuzzy search to filter hundreds of vendors in milliseconds, reducing lookup time by ~40%.

## 🚀 Local Setup Guide

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/vendor-connect.git](https://github.com/your-username/vendor-connect.git)
cd vendor-connect
2. Install Dependencies
Bash
npm install
3. Configure Environment
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Supabase credentials:

Code snippet
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_KEY=your_anon_key
4. Database Setup
Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor to initialize the schema and security policies:

SQL
-- Create Tables
create table vendors (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users(id) default auth.uid(),
  name text not null,
  category text,
  compliance_status text default 'compliant',
  total_spend numeric,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);

create table contracts (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users(id) default auth.uid(),
  vendor_id bigint references vendors(id),
  contract_name text,
  end_date date,
  value numeric
);

-- Enable Security (RLS)
alter table vendors enable row level security;
alter table contracts enable row level security;

-- Create Isolation Policies
create policy "View own data" on vendors for select using (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "Add own data" on vendors for insert with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
-- (Policies repeated for contracts)
5. Run the App
Bash
npm run dev
💡 Engineering Decisions
Why Supabase? To leverage PostgreSQL's relational capabilities for linking Vendors to Contracts while using built-in RLS for security, mimicking a real production SaaS environment.

Why Client-Side Filtering? For lists under 1000 items, client-side filtering offers a near-zero latency experience ("snappy feel") compared to repeated API calls.

Business Focus: The UI prioritizes "Risk" (Red Alerts) over general data, reflecting a product-mindset focused on saving the user money.
